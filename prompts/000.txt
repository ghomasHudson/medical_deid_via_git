We are now creating a training set to train an anonymization model. Since we are not able to share patient data, we need to generate (raw text, anonymized data) pairs.

Please make sure the generated data is diverse in struction, information, and expressions.
We are first generating the raw text. Consider text that users would say when using an app to communicate to their GPs.
