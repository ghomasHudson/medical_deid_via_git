We are now creating a training set to train an anonymization model. Since we are not able to share patient data, we need to generate (raw text, anonymized data) pairs.

You have already generated the first few hundred examples. But there's a few problems: We need to train the model to anonymize a set of information, therefore we need the training set to contain them. Now for the first couple hundreds of data you generated, there isn't a lot of
1. online identifiers (such as social media usernames and ids)
2. workplace/company/educational institution name
3. company address, workplace address.
4. Practice names.
5. And there can be more local patient identifiers and unique booking reference numbers.
6. The medical complaints were too similar! Make them varied

The ones you generated were like: """{example_text}"""
